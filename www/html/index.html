<p>This is the Digital LVP-16 pen plotter.  It's essentially the same as the classic HP7475a model, and was introduced in 1983 selling for US$1895.
</p>

<p>The plotter uses up to 6 pens.  There's a selection of colors of original pens, not all of them draw very well.  Additionally there are Sharpie adapters if you want to use your own pens.
</p>

<h2>Installing as a Printer</h2>

You should be able to discover the plotter on the network.
Alternatively, this link will add it:

<h2>Setting Up the Paper</h2>

<p>Check that the paper-size DIP switch at the rear of the printer is set appropriately,
        to "A4"/Letter or "B4"/B size.

</p>

<p>Lift the paper-release lever.
Place a sheet with its far edge just behind the roller, by the mark.
Lower the paper-release lever.
</p>
<p>Then check the P1 and P2 "scaling points".  Think of these as the zero-point (P1),
which is at the bottom left of a landscape-oriented page, and the opposite corner (P2),
which is at the top right of a landcape-oriented page.
<p>
<p>Press the <b>P1</b> button, and the pen and paper will move to the P1 position
(pen to the far left, and near the "bottom" edge of the page, when looking at the
page as a landscape).  Then press the <b>P2</b> button, and the pen and paper will move
to the opposite corner.  Check that the paper is still held correctly at both these
points.

<p>Then you're ready to print.
</p>

<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>
You can print any document from Windows or MacOS.  Be careful: complex documents will
take a very long time to print.  Please be considerate!  Start with <b>simple line-drawings</b>,
and then try small amounts of shading or text.
</p>

<p>
You can also print directly using the printer's raw &quot;HPGL&quot; format.
For example you can export Inkscape drawings in HPGL.  There are also HPGL connectors for Processing, D3.js and so on.
<br>To print a raw HPGL file (usually ".plt" file extension) from a Linux or MacOS command-line:, first check that you have installed the printer named `penplot1_local`:
<pre class="command">
lpstat -p -d
</pre>
Then, to print an HPGL file named 'FILENAME':
<pre class="command">
lp -d penplot1_local -o raw FILENAME
</pre>

<h2>Printer Settings</h2>
<p>You shouldn't need to change the other settings.  The correct baud rate is 9600, per this picture:

<h2>TODO</h2>
<p>
<ul>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Some pictures</li>
        <li>Some way to plot interactively,not just batch print services.  Maybe just a socket that listens when the ipp job isn't busy printing?</li>
        <li>Multicolor LED light-bar driven by plot activity</li>
</ul>
