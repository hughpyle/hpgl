<h1 class="title">penplot1</h1>

<p>This is the Digital LVP-16 pen plotter.  It's essentially the same as the classic HP7475a model, and was introduced in 1983 selling for US$1895.
</p>

<p>The plotter uses up to 6 pens.  There's a selection of colors of original pens, not all of them draw very well.  Additionally there are Sharpie adapters if you want to use your own pens.
</p>

<h2>Installing as a Printer</h2>

You should be able to discover the plotter on the network.
Alternatively, this link will add it:

<h2>Printing</h2>
<p>
You can print any document from Windows or MacOS.  Be careful: complex documents will
take a very long time to print.  Please be considerate!  Start with <b>simple line-drawings</b>,
and then try small amounts of shading or text.
</p>

<p>
You can also print directly using the printer's raw &quot;HPGL&quot; format.
For example you can export Inkscape drawings in HPGL.  There are also HPGL connectors for Processing, D3.js and so on.
<br>To print a raw HPGL file (usually ".plt" file extension) from a Linux or MacOS command-line:, first check that you have installed the printer named `penplot1_local`:
<pre class="command">
lpstat -p -d
</pre>
Then, to print an HPGL file named 'FILENAME':
<pre class="command">
lp -d penplot1_local -o raw FILENAME
</pre>
